# Fish Eat Fish
**I will be generating a 2D sea and there are many fish, and the
player can eat the fish and stuff that are “smaller” than itself. The larger object will be
attracted by the player because it will be seen as food. While eating, the player will grow
bigger and bigger. After getting bigger and bigger, there will be bombs in the sea and the player need to dodge them in order to live!
